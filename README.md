## Kiwi Tasker

Kiwi Tasker is job system using fibers based on the [GDC talk Parallelizing the Naughty Dog Engine Using Fibers](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022186/Parallelizing-the-Naughty-Dog-Engine) done by Christian Gyrling. I recommend watching the talk to get an ideal on how to use the library and fibers in general.

This library is still in development. It currently supports 64 bit Windows and Linux, support for additional operations and architecture are very easy to add.
